## 2) Blocking Questions (max 10) — with recommended defaults

### 1) Auth + contribution model (BLOCKING: security/usability)

**You flagged** “paste Supabase user id as a password-like token.” This is **not safe** (a user ID isn’t a secret; it’s guessable/observable, and it doesn’t prove identity).
**Choose one:**

* **A. Magic link (recommended default):** email-only, no password. Lowest friction that’s still real auth.
* **B. Anonymous browse + “submit lineup” form → approval queue:** contributors don’t need accounts; admins approve/publish. (Great if you want ultra-low friction and are okay with moderation.)
* **C. Invite code → creates lightweight account or “contributor session”:** share a code with friends/Discord; rotate codes.
* **D. OAuth (Steam/Discord/Google):** slightly heavier but familiar.

**Default if you don’t choose:** **A (Magic link)** + public read, authenticated create.

### 2) Visibility + access: public vs private maps/lineups (BLOCKING)

* Are lineups **publicly readable** to anyone with the link / anyone who opens the app, or private to a group?
* Should share links work for **logged-out viewers**?

**Default:** Public read for all published lineups; share links work without login.

### 3) Publishing & moderation (BLOCKING)

When a contributor creates a lineup, does it:

* publish immediately, or
* go into “pending” until approved?

**Default:** **Immediate publish for trusted/auth users** + **rate limiting**; optional “pending queue” only for anonymous submissions if you pick model B.

### 4) Editing & ownership rules (BLOCKING)

Who can edit/delete an existing lineup?

* Creator only?
* Any authenticated contributor?
* Admins only?
  And do edits overwrite or create versions?

**Default:** Creator can edit/delete their own; admins can edit/delete any; edits overwrite (no full version history in MVP, but store `updated_at` + `updated_by`).

### 5) Duplicate handling: landing pin merges and lineup grouping (BLOCKING)

You allow multiple lineups per landing pin. Define “same landing pin”:

* exact same coordinates,
* within a radius threshold (e.g., ≤ 8px or ≤ 1% map width),
* or manual merge by admin.

**Default:** Auto-group by **radius threshold** + same map; allow admin “merge pins” tool later (not MVP).

### 6) Favorites/bookmarks scope (BLOCKING)

Are favorites:

* per-user account (requires auth), or
* local-only (browser localStorage), or
* both?

**Default:** **Local-only for logged-out**, and if user logs in, **sync to account** (migrate local → server once).

### 7) Media storage constraints (BLOCKING)

You require 3 screenshots, optional video/GIF.

* Max sizes? Allowed formats?
* Any client-side compression/resizing?
* Is video/GIF allowed in MVP or gated behind a size cap?

**Default:** Images: PNG/JPG/WebP up to **5MB each** (auto-compress to WebP client-side). Video/GIF: optional, **≤ 15MB** (or disable video in MVP if you want simplest).

### 8) Map set & data source (BLOCKING)

How many maps ship in MVP, and how are maps represented?

* One initial map only?
* Multiple maps with different SVGs?
* Do maps need named regions (A/B/Mid) encoded?

**Default:** Start with **1–3 maps**. Each map has: SVG, coordinate system, and optional region polygons/labels for A/B/Mid filtering.

### 9) Region filter definition (BLOCKING if included in MVP)

If you include A/B/Mid filter: is region assigned by:

* creator selecting A/B/Mid in the form, or
* computed from coordinates via polygons, or
* both (computed suggestion, editable)?

**Default:** Creator selects A/B/Mid in form (fastest). If you already have region polygons, compute a default and let user override.

### 10) Soft realtime implementation boundary (BLOCKING)

What triggers “New lineup available”?

* Any new lineup on current map that matches current filters?
* Any new lineup on the selected map (even if filtered out)?
* Only from followed/favorited pins?

**Default:** Toast when **new published lineup exists for selected map**, regardless of current filters; toast text clarifies “New lineups on this map.”

## 3) Non-blocking Questions (optional) — with defaults

* **Pin tooltip label source:** title vs short label field?
  **Default:** Use `title` truncated; add optional `short_label` later.

* **Coordinate precision:** store as normalized (0–1) vs SVG pixels?
  **Default:** Store **normalized** (x,y in 0..1 relative to SVG viewBox) so it survives responsive scaling.

* **Share link shape:** `/map/:mapSlug?pin=:pinId&lineup=:lineupId` vs short ids.
  **Default:** readable URL with IDs; add short links later.

* **Accessibility baseline:** keyboard close modal (Esc), focus trap, aria labels.
  **Default:** Yes.

## 4) Next Step — what I need from you (assets/spec files) before the final dev prompt

Upload/provide (even rough is fine):

1. **Map SVG(s)** for MVP

* 1–3 SVG files, plus their **map names/slugs**.
* Confirm the SVGs are already in the coordinate space you want (no dynamic layers needed).

2. **Region definitions** (only if you want A/B/Mid to be computed)

* Either: polygons/paths per region per map, or tell me “creator will select region manually” (then no polygons needed).

3. **Lineup media examples** (2–3 sample sets)

* Example screenshots (position/aim/result) and (optional) one video/GIF so we can set sane format/size rules.

4. **Brand/UI baseline**

* Logo (optional), preferred color(s), and whether dark mode is required in MVP.
* If nothing: I’ll assume a clean neutral theme + dark-mode-friendly palette.

5. **Your choice on the 10 blocking questions above** (bullet answers are enough)

* Especially #1 (auth model), #3–#5 (moderation/edit/dupes), and #8–#9 (maps/regions).

Once you answer those + provide the map SVG(s), I can produce the final:

* **Development Prompt for ChadGPT_Dev** (in your required structure) 
* **Context Pack Checklist** (exact files/assets + naming conventions)
