4) How users discover lineups on the map

When a user is browsing, how do pins behave?

Show all pins by default, or only pins matching filters?

On hover: tooltip preview (name/type), or nothing?

On click: open side panel details, or modal, or new page?

5) Filter system (you gotta choose the mental model)

What’s the filter stack?

Required filters: Map, Side (T/CT), Utility type (smoke/flash/molly/HE), Site (A/B/Mid)?

Do you want multi-select (multiple utility types at once) or single-select?

Do filters live in: sidebar, top bar, or a floating filter button?

6) Searching

What should search query against?

lineup name, tags, notes, author, map region labels, grenade type?
And do you want search to:

filter the list only, or also highlight matching pins on the map?

7) “Add lineup” entry point

How does creation start?

A) Big “+ Add lineup” button

B) Right-click on map (“Add lineup here”)

C) Hotkey (e.g., N)

D) From a toolbar on the map

8) Add lineup flow (this is the core UX)

When adding a lineup, do you want:

Step 1: place pin(s) on map → then fill form
or

Step 1: choose type + side + title → then place pin(s)

And do you store one pin or two pins?

A) only the landing location (where smoke lands)

B) only the throw position (where player stands)

C) both throw position + landing position (recommended)
If both: do you want two different colored icons or different shapes?

9) Lineup detail page/panel contents

What’s mandatory in the details view?

Title, utility type, side, short description, tags

Step-by-step instructions (text)

Crosshair lineup screenshot? (optional)

Video/gif link or upload?

“Copy share link” button?

“Open on map and highlight” button?

10) Editing / versions (collab apps live or die here)

When a lineup is edited:

A) overwrite silently

B) create a new version (history)

C) propose edit that needs approval
Also: who can edit?

only author, or trusted contributors, or anyone?

11) Moderation + trust (minimum viable rules)

Pick your MVP moderation model:

A) Public read, auth required to submit, submissions go live immediately

B) Public read, auth required to submit, approval queue

C) Private groups/teams only
Also: do you want “Report lineup” button in MVP?

12) “Auto-update” behavior (be specific)

When someone adds a lineup, how should other clients update?

A) Live realtime (pins appear immediately)

B) Soft realtime (toast: “New lineup available → refresh list”)

C) Polling every X minutes
And if you’re currently viewing that map, should it:

auto-add the pin to the map instantly, or wait until you clear a toast?

13) Map interaction mechanics

Zoom/pan: mouse wheel + drag? touchpad? buttons?

Pin snapping: free placement or snap-to-grid?

Do you want region labels on the SVG (clickable areas) or keep SVG purely visual?

14) “Save time” features (choose 0–2 for MVP)

Which of these are MVP-worthy?

Favorites / bookmarks

“My submissions” tab

Upvote / rating

Comment thread on lineup

Collections/playlists (“my Mirage exec set”)

Once you answer these, I’ll produce a custom boot prompt that:

forces Kirkceptually to lock these decisions first

makes it generate the exact “Development Prompt for ChadGPT_Dev”

generates the “Context Pack Checklist” specifically including your SVG coordinate rules + icons naming + Supabase realtime plan
